REQUIRED!
---------
You need to have the following installed to be able to use Virtual Vacation.

- Perl5
- Perl DBI
- Either Perl DBD::mysql OR Perl DBD::pgsql - depending on DB backend.
- Email::Valid
- Mail::Sendmail


About Virtual Vacation
----------------------
Virual Vacation is today done with a local shell account that can receive
email. The email is then handled by a Perl script which sends the Vacation
message back to the sender.


Install Virtual Vacation
------------------------

1. Create a local account
-------------------------
Create a dedicated local user account called "vacation". 
This user handles all potentially dangerous mail content - that is why it
should be a separate account.

Do not use "nobody", and most certainly do not use "root" or "postfix".  The
user will never log in, and can be given a "*" password and non-existent
shell and home directory.

This should look like this:

#/etc/passwd
vacation:*:65501:65501::0:0:Virtual Vacation:/nonexistent:/sbin/nologin

#/etc/group
vacation:*:65501:

2. Create a directory
---------------------
Create a directory, for example  /var/spool/vacation, that is accessible
only to the "vacation" user. This is where the vacation script is supposed
to store its temporary files. 


3. Copy the files
-----------------

Copy the vacation.pl file to the directory you created above:

  $ cp vacation.pl <HOME>/vacation.pl
  $ chown -R vacation:vacation <HOME>

Which will then look something like:

-rwx------   1 vacation  vacation  3356 Dec 21 00:00 vacation.pl*

4. Setup the transport type
--------------------
Define the transport type in the Postfix master file:

#/etc/postfix/master.cf:
vacation    unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
  flags=Rq user=vacation argv=/var/spool/vacation/vacation.pl -f ${sender} -- ${recipient}

Tell Postfix to use a transport maps file, so add the following to your
Postfix main.cf:

#/etc/postfix/main.cf:
transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport

Then add the transport definition to the newly created transport file.
Obviously, change yourdomain.com to your own domain. This can be any
arbitrary domain, and it is easiest if you just choose one that will be used
for all your domains.

#/etc/postfix/transport
autoreply.yourdomain.com	vacation:

Execute "postmap /etc/postfix/transport" to build the hashed database.

Execute "postfix reload" to complete the change.


5. Create the table
-------------------

See DATABASE.txt in this directory.

6. Edit filter.pl
-----------------

The perl filter.pl script needs minor modification to know which database 
you are using, and also how to connect to the database.

Namely :

Change any variables starting with '$db_' and '$db_type' to either 'mysql' or 'pgsql'.



What do these files do?
-----------------------
When a user enables a vacation message on their account, the alias
definition is changed so that in addition to delivering to their own
mailbox, it also delivers to a dummy alias which calls the vacation.pl
program. In other words, if joeuser@domain.com enables their vacation, the
entry in the alias database table will deliver mail to
joeuser@something.com, as well as
joeuser@something.com@autoreply.yourdomain.com

vacation.pl then checks the database to see wether a user is on holiday and
what message to send back. Make sure that vacation.pl is able to communicate
to your databse. In the first couple of lines you have to specify the
database, username and password for it.
NOTE: Make sure that the path to perl is correct.


I'm in trouble!
---------------
When something is not working there are a couple of files that you can have
a look at. The most important one is your maillog (usually in /var/log/).

Vacation.pl also has some debugging and logging capabilties. Check the top
of vacation.pl.


Done!
-----
When this is all in place you need to have a look at the Postfix Admin
config.inc.php. Here you need to enable Virtual Vacation for the site.
