Frequently Asked Questions:


1) Why isn't PostfixAdmin creating my mailbox?

 - PostfixAdmin is only a web interface for storing configuration settings. 
   It does not (by default!) have the ability to create mail folders on disk. 
   In a normal setup, sending the 'Welcome' email accomplishes this task - 
   as Courier/Cyrus/etc do it (and have permission to do so)
