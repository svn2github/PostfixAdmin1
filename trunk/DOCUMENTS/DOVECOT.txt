1. Dovecot setup
-----------------

dovecot.conf relevant part for postfixadmin setup
Please refer to Dovecot documentation for complete information.

default_mail_env = maildir:/usr/local/virtual/%u/


# auth_userdb specifies maildir location  and user/group ID to use
auth_userdb = mysql /etc/dovecot/dovecot-mysql.conf

# auth_passdb specifies user passwords
auth_passdb = mysql /etc/dovecot/dovecot-mysql.conf

# Valid UID range for users, defaults to 500 and above.
first_valid_uid = 1001  # Change this to your postifx UID


2. Dovecot mysql setup
----------------------

Below you'll find the relevant part of dovecot-mysql.conf file regarding our setup
Things you may need to change are db_password, uid and gid

db_host = localhost
db_port = 3306
# Default sock for Debian sarge
db_unix_socket = /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
db = postfix
db_user = postfix
db_passwd = postfix
db_client_flags = 0

# Default password scheme.

default_pass_scheme = PLAIN-MD5

# Query to retrieve password.

password_query = SELECT password FROM mailbox WHERE username = '%u'

# Query to retrieve user information.

user_query = SELECT maildir, 1001 AS uid, 1001 AS gid FROM mailbox WHERE username = '%u'

NB The GID and UID are for postfix user and group ID, NOT MySQL user and group ID.
