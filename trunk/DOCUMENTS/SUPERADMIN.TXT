  Recreating a superadmin account


The database scripts DATABASE_MYSQL.TXT and DATABASE_PGSQL.TXT create a super admin
 of admin@domain.tld, password: admin 
 
With that login you can create new superadmins (and you should delete or change the
password of  admin@domain.tld). If that user is no longer there or you didn't use
the .TXT files, you could add another manually from the database. Just use the code
from one of the .TXT files.  Do this as root on the MySQL machine: 
 
# mysql 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or \g. 
Your MySQL connection id is 8186 to server version: 5.0.27 
 
Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer. 
 
mysql> use postfix 
Reading table information for completion of table and column names 
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A 
 
Database changed 
mysql> INSERT INTO domain_admins (username, domain, active) VALUES ('new@domain.tld','ALL','1'); 
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec) 
 
mysql> INSERT INTO admin (username, password, active) VALUES ('new@domain.tld','$1$0fec9189$bgI6ncWrldPOsXnkUBIjl1','1'); 
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec) 
 
mysql> exit 
Bye 
 
Then you can log in as new@domain.tld, password: admin
