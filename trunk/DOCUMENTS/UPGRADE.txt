REQUIRED!!
----------
- You are using Postfix 2.0 or higher.
- You are using Apache 1.3.27 / Lighttpd 1.3.15 or higher.
- You are using PHP 4.1 or higher.
- You are using MySQL 3.23 or higher.


READ THIS FIRST!
----------------

This document describes upgrading from an older PostfixAdmin version
(>= v1.5x)

It's recommened that you install Postfix Admin in a new folder and not
on-top of the old install!!

When upgrading Postfix Admin, make sure you backup your database before
running upgrade.php.


1. Backup the Database
----------------------
When you install from a previous version make sure you backup your database
first. There are a lot of changes in the database structure since Postfix Admin
1.5.4.

  $ mysqldump -a -u root -p > /tmp/postfixadmin-backup.sql


2. Unarchive new Postfix Admin
------------------------------
Make sure that you are in your WWW directory and then unarchive the
Postfix Admin archive (whatever the filename is):

  $ tar -zxvf postfixadmin-2.2.tgz


3. Change permissions
----------------------
Since the database password is stored in the config.inc.php it's a good idea
to have change the permissions for Postfix Admin.

  $ cd /usr/local/www/postfixadmin
  $ find -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chmod 640
  $ find -type f -print0 | xargs -0 chown root:www

(the last command assumes your Apache is running with group "www")


4. Configure
------------
Check the config.inc.php file. There you can specify settings that are
relevant to your setup.

Comparing config.inc.php with your previous using "diff" might save you some
time.


5. Modify the MySQL Tables
--------------------------
Open upgrade.php in your browser to update your database scheme.

If you update from 2.1 or older, also open setup.php to create a superadmin
account.

Note that admin/ has been merged into the main directory. Login with the
superadmin account to setup domains and domain admins.


6. Delete setup.php
-------------------
Delete setup.php - it allown non-authorized users to create a superadmin
account!


7. Done
-------
This is all that is needed. Fire up your browser and go to the site that you
specified to host Postfix Admin.
