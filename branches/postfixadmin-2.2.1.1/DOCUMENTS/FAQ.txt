Frequently Asked Questions:


1) Why isn't PostfixAdmin creating my mailbox?

 - PostfixAdmin is only a web interface for storing configuration settings. 
   It does not (by default!) have the ability to create mail folders on disk. 
   In a normal setup, sending the 'Welcome' email accomplishes this task - 
   as Courier/Cyrus/etc do it (and have permission to do so)


2) I've deleted the mailbox from PostfixAdmin, yet it still exists on disk? Why?

 - This is related to #1 above - namely, PostfixAdmin (which is a php web 
   application) does not have permission to modify the mailbox files on disk.
   You need to either manually remove the directories 
   (e.g. rm -Rf /var/spool/mail/vmail/something@example.org) 
   or install the postfixadmin-mailbox-postdeletion.sh script (See ADDITIONS/)
   and modify config.inc.php appropriately.
