  Postfix configuration for use with PostfixAdmin

-----------------------

  Your installation of Postfix MUST support either MySQL or Postgres
lookup tables.  You can verify that with 'postconf -m'

Its generally recommended to use proxy as well (which should also appear in
postconf -m)  Three main.cf variables are involved:

virtual_alias_maps = proxy:mysql:/etc/postfix/sql/mysql_virtual_alias_maps.cf
virtual_mailbox_domains = proxy:mysql:/etc/postfix/sql/mysql_virtual_domains_maps.cf
virtual_mailbox_maps = proxy:mysql:/etc/postfix/sql/mysql_virtual_mailbox_maps.cf

Where you chose to store the .cf files doesn't really matter, but they will
have database passwords stored in plain text so they should be readable only
by user postfix, or in a directory only accessible to user postfix.

This isn't necessarily all you need to do to Postfix to get up and
running.  Also, additional changes are needed for the vacation
autoreply features.

  Contents of the files

These are examples only, you will likely have to and want to make some
cumtomizations.  You will also want to consider the config.inc.php
settings for domain_path and domain_in_mailbox.  These examples
use values of domain_path=YES and domain_in_mailbox=NO

mysql_virtual_alias_maps.cf:
user = postfix
password = password
hosts = localhost
dbname = postfix
query           = SELECT goto FROM alias WHERE address='%s' AND active = '1'
#expansion_limit = 100


mysql_virtual_domains_maps.cf:
user = postfix
password = password
hosts = localhost
dbname = postfix
query          = SELECT domain FROM domain WHERE domain='%u'
#query          = SELECT domain FROM domain WHERE domain='%s'
#optional query to use when relaying for backup MX
#query           = SELECT domain FROM domain WHERE domain='%s' AND backupmx = '0' AND active = '1'
#expansion_limit = 100


mysql_virtual_mailbox_maps.cf:
user = postfix
password = password
hosts = localhost
dbname = postfix
query           = SELECT CONCAT(domain,'/',maildir) FROM mailbox WHERE username='%s' AND active = '1'
#expansion_limit = 100
