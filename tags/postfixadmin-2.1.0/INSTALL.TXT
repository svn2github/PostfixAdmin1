REQUIRED!!
----------
- You are using Postfix 2.0 or higher.
- You are using Apache 1.3.27 or higher.
- You are using PHP 4.1 or higher.
- You are using MySQL 3.23 or higher.


READ THIS FIRST!
----------------
When this is an upgrade from Postfix Admin 1.5.4 please read UPGRADE.TXT!!

If you need to setup Postfix to be able to handle Virtual Domains and Virtual
Users check out http://high5.net/howto/


1. Unarchive new Postfix Admin
------------------------------
Make sure that you are in your WWW directory and then unarchive the
Postfix Admin archive (whatever the filename is):

  $ tar -zxvf postfixadmin-2.0.0.tgz


2. Change permissions
----------------------
Since the database  password is stored in the config.inc.php it's a good idea
to have change the permissions for Postfix Admin.

  $ cd /usr/local/www/postfixadmin
  $ chmod 640 *.php *.css
  $ cd /usr/local/www/postfixadmin/admin/
  $ chmod 640 *.php .ht*
  $ cd /usr/local/www/postfixadmin/images/
  $ chmod 640 *.gif *.png
  $ cd /usr/local/www/postfixadmin/languages/
  $ chmod 640 *.lang
  $ cd /usr/local/www/postfixadmin/templates/
  $ chmod 640 *.tpl
  $ cd /usr/local/www/postfixadmin/users/
  $ chmod 640 *.php
  

3. Create the Database Tables
--------------------------
In DATABASE_MYSQL.TXT you can find the table structure for MySQL that you need 
in order to configure Postfix Admin and Postfix in general to work with
Virtual Domains and Users.

In DATABASE_PGSQL.TXT you can find the table structure for PostgreSQL.


4. Configure
------------
Check the config.inc.php file. There you can specify settings that are
relevant to your setup.

Postfix Admin contains 3 views of administration.
There is the Site Admin view, located at http://domain.tld/postfixadmin/admin/.
There is the Domain Admin view, located at http://domain.tld/postfixadmin/.
And there is the User Admin View, located at http://domain.tld/postfixadmin/users/.

In order to do the initial configuration you have to go to the Site Admin view.

The default password for the Site Admin view of Postfix Admin is admin/admin.

This is specified in the .htpasswd file in the /admin directory. Make sure
that the location of the .htpasswd file matches your path.


5. Done
-------
This is all that is needed. Fire up your browser and go to the site that you
specified to host Postfix Admin.
