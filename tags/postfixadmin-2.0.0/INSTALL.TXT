REQUIRED!!
----------
- You are using Postfix 2.0 or higher.
- You are using Apache 1.3.27 or higher.
- You are using PHP 4.1 or higher.
- You are using MySQL 3.23.55 or higher.


READ THIS FIRST!
----------------
When this is an upgrade from Postfix Admin 1.5.4 please read UPGRADE.TXT!!
If you used the table structure from the Howto please read the UPGRADE.TXT!!


1. Unarchive new Postfix Admin
------------------------------
Make sure that you are in your WWW directory and then unarchive the
Postfix Admin archive (whatever the filename is):

  $ tar -zxvf postfixadmin-2.0.0.tgz


2. Change permissions
----------------------
Since the database  password is stored in the config.inc.php it's a good idea
to have Postfix Admin set to the permission of the webserver. In this
example, we assume that user "www" and group "www" are the web server as is
often the case with Apache.

  $ cd /usr/local/www
  $ chown -R www:www postfixadmin-2.0.0

This is also a good idea for the file permissions.

  $ cd /usr/local/www/postfixadmin-2.0.0
  $ chmod 640 *.php *.css
  $ cd /usr/local/www/postfixadmin-2.0.0/admin/
  $ chmod 640 *.php *.css
  $ cd /usr/local/www/postfixadmin-2.0.0/users/
  $ chmod 640 *.php *.css
  $ cd /usr/local/www/postfixadmin-2.0.0/templates/
  $ chmod 640 *.php *.css
  
Additionally, if "chown user:group" doesn't work, you can use "chown user"
and "chgrp group" instead. See the man pages for these commands for more
information.


3. Create the MySQL Tables
--------------------------
In DATABASE.TXT you can find the table structure that you need in order to
configure Postfix Admin and Postfix in general to work with Virtual Domains
and Users


4. Configure
------------
Check the config.inc.php file. There you can specify settings that are
relevant to your setup.

The default password for the admin part of Postfix Admin is admin/admin.
This is specified in the .htpasswd file in the admin directory. Make sure
that the location of the .htpasswd file matches your path.


5. Done
-------
This is all that is needed. Fire up your browser and go to the site that you
specified to host Postfix Admin.
