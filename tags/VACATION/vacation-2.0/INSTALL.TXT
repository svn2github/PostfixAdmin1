REQUIRED!
---------
You need to have the following installed to be able to use Virtual Vacation.
- Procmail
- Perl5
- Perl DBI


About Virtual Vacation
----------------------
Virual Vacation is today done with a local shell account that can receive
email. The email is then handled by a Perl script which sends the Vacation
message back to the sender.


Install Virtual Vacation
------------------------
First you need to create a local user account, or shell account, which is
going to be used to handle vacation email.
When you don't know how to do this please consult your local administrator

NOTE: The shell for this account needs to be a real shell NOT /nonexistent

Second you need to copy the included files to the home directory of that
user. The files that you need to copy are.

  $ cp dot.forward <HOME>/.forward
  $ cp dot.procmailrc <HOME>/.procmailrc
  $ cp vacation.pl <HOME>/vacation.pl

Which will then look something like:

-rw-r--r--   1 vacation  users    28 Jun 16 00:00 .forward
-rw-r--r--   1 vacation  users   291 Jun 16 00:00 .procmailrc
-rwx------   1 vacation  users  1129 Jun 16 00:00 vacation.pl*

To use Virtual Vacation with Postfix Admin you need to create an extra table
in the database that is used by Postfix Admin.

USE postfix;
CREATE TABLE vacation (
  email varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
  subject varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
  body text NOT NULL
) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Virtual Vacation - Vacation Daemon Table';


What do these files do?
-----------------------
The .forward redirects every email that it received to procmail.
NOTE: Make sure that the path to procmail is correct.

The .procmailrc will strip out the from, to and subject header which are
then send to the vacation.pl script.

Vacation.pl then checks the database to see wether a user is on holiday and
what message to send back. Make sure that vacation.pl is able to communicate
to your databse. In the first couple of lines you have to specify the
database, username and password for it.
NOTE: Make sure that the path to perl is correct.


I'm in trouble!
---------------
When something is not working there are a couple of files that you can have
a look at. The most important one is your maillog (usually in /var/log/).

There is also a logfile for whatever procmail is doing, just uncomment the
line in the .procmailrc.

Vacation.pl also has some debugging and logging capabilties. Check the top
of vacation.pl.


Done!
-----
When this is all in place you need to have a look at the Postfix Admin
config.inc.php. Here you need to enable Virtual Vacation for the site.
