You need to have the following installed to be able to use Virtual Vacation.
- Procmail
- Perl5
- Perl DBI


Upgrade from 1.x to 2.0
-----------------------
The files that have changed are .procmailrc and vacation.pl.
Copy these files to the location where you have vacation stored.

  $ cp dot.procmailrc <HOME>/.procmailrc
  $ cp vacation.pl <HOME>/vacation.pl

Again some changes on the caching side. This is no longer done with formail,
but is builtin vacation.pl. Name of the files are now: cache.<email address>

  $ rm <HOME>/*.cache

The log file format has also changed. You might want to delete the old
files.
