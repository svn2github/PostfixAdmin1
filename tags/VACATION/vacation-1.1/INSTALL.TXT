You need to have the following installed to be able to use Virtual Vacation.
- Procmail
- Perl
- Perl DBI


About Virtual Vacation
----------------------
Virual Vacation is today done with a local shell account that can receive
email. The email is then handled by a Perl script which sends the Vacation
message back to the sender.


Install Virtual Vacation
------------------------
First you need to create a local user account, or shell account, which is
going to be used to handle vacation email.
When you don't know how to do this please consult your local administrator

Second you need to copy the included files to the home directory of that
user. The files that you need to copy are.

  $ cp dot.forward <HOME>/.forward
  $ cp dot.procmailrc <HOME>/.procmailrc
  $ cp vacation.pl <HOME>/vacation.pl

Which will then look something like:

-rw-r--r--   1 vacation  users    28 Jun 16 00:00 .forward
-rw-r--r--   1 vacation  users   291 Jun 16 00:00 .procmailrc
-rwx------   1 vacation  users  1129 Jun 16 00:00 vacation.pl*

To use Virtual Vacation with Postfix Admin you need to create an extra table
in the database that is used by Postfix Admin.

USE postfix;
CREATE TABLE vacation (
  email varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
  subject varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
  body text NOT NULL
) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='Virtual Vacation - Vacation Daemon Table';


What do these files do?
-----------------------
The .forward redirects every email that it received to the .procmailrc.
The .procmailrc will strip out the from, to and subject header which are
then send to the vacation.pl script.

Vacation.pl then checks the database to see wether a user is on holiday and
what message to send back.


Done!
-----
When this is all in place you need to have a look at the Postfix Admin
config.inc.php. Here you need to enable Virtual Vacation for the site.
