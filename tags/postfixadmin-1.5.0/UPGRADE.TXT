Upgrade from 1.4.x and older
----------------------------
Since some features have been added to this release which are partially
coming from config.inc.php it's wise to do a complete upgrade and modify your
settings in the new config.inc.php.


1. Backup old installation
---------------------------
Make a backup of your current Postfix Admin  directory. If you use "cp", be
sure to use the "-Rp" options. -R means recursive, and -p will save the
permissions in the directory.

In this example, we assume that your httpd document directory is 
/usr/local/postfixadmin, that your Postfix Admin install is located at
/usr/local/postfixadmin/postfixadmin, and that your new Postfix Admin version is 1.5.0.
Substitute version numbers and names as required.

  $ cd /usr/local/postfixadmin
  $ cp -Rp postfixadmin postfixadmin.old


2. Unarchive new Postfix Admin
------------------------------
Make sure that you are in your /usr/local/postfixadmin/ directory and then unarchive the
Postfix Admin archive (whatever the filename is):

  $ tar -zxvf postfixadmin-1.5.0.tgz


3. Change permissions
----------------------
Since the database  password is stored in the config.inc.php it's a good idea
to have Postfix Admin set to the permission of the webserver. In this
example, we assume that user "www" and group "www" are the web server as is
often the case with Apache.

  $ cd /usr/local/postfixadmin/
  $ chown -R www:www postfixadmin

This is also a good idea for the file permissions.

  $ cd /usr/local/postfixadmin/postfixadmin
  $ chmod 640 *.php *.css
  $ cd /usr/local/postfixadmin/postfixadmin/admin
  $ chmod 640 *.php *.css
  
Additionally, if "chown user:group" doesn't work, you can use "chown user"
and "chgrp group" instead. See the man pages for these commands for more
information.


4. Create the MySQL Tables
--------------------------
In INSTALL.TXT you can find the table structure that you need in order to
configure Postfix Admin and Postfix in general to work with Virtual Domains
and Users


5. Configure
------------
Look at the file config.inc.php in the root of Postfix Admin, here you can
specify the username and possword of the Postfix Admin user as well as the
database name.

In this file you can also find the text that is displayed as the title,
header and footer. You can change this as you see fit.
To change the background and text color please check the stylesheet.css

In config.inc.php in the admin directory you can find an array of default
aliases that are created when a new domain is created. You can change these
aliases so that they reflect your setup.

The default password for the admin part of Postfix Admin is admin/admin.
This is specified in the .htpasswd file in the admin directory.
Make sure that the location of the .htpasswd file matches your path.


6. Done
-------
This is all that is needed. Fire up your browser and go to the site that you
specified to host Postfix Admin.
